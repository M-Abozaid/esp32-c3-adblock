# esp32-c3-adblock

A **Pi-hole-style DNS ad-blocker** that runs on a **$2 ESP32-C3** — *no PSRAM required*.

The trick everyone misses: you don't need to keep the blocklist in RAM. Store the
domains as **sorted 40-bit hashes in flash** and binary-search them. 140,000+ domains
fit in ~0.7 MB of flash and are matched in ~2 ms, using **~73 KB of RAM**
(including a 20 KB first-level index and a 2 KB cache).

```
query in ──▶ extract domain ──▶ FNV-1a hash (+ parent suffixes)
         ──▶ check RAM cache / index, then read one flash bucket
              ├─ hit  ──▶ answer 0.0.0.0   (sinkholed)
              └─ miss ──▶ forward to upstream resolver, relay the reply
```

## Why this is interesting

Most ESP32 DNS sinkholes load the blocklist (domain *strings*) into RAM, so they
demand PSRAM. This project stores fixed **5-byte (40-bit) hashes in flash** instead:

| | string-in-RAM approach | this (hash-in-flash) |
|---|---|---|
| Hardware | ESP32 + PSRAM (~$8) | ESP32-C3, no PSRAM (~$2) |
| 141k domains | ~2.5 MB of RAM | **0.67 MB of flash** |
| RAM used | most of it | **~73 KB** |
| Lookup | string compare | RAM index + cache; ~1 flash read per suffix |
| Collisions | n/a | 0 at 141k (1 at 537k) |

**Why 40 bits?** It's the sweet spot for this flash budget. Collisions follow the
birthday bound — at 141k domains you get ~0, at 537k about 1 (i.e. one unlucky
domain gets over-blocked). Dropping to 32 bits would save 20% of the flash but
cost ~7 collisions at 250k; going to 64 bits wastes 3 bytes per domain to solve
a problem you don't have.

The same trick works on bigger chips — it isn't a C3 workaround. On a 16 MB
ESP32-S3 these hashes hold **~2.7M domains** vs ~466k for strings in 8 MB of
PSRAM. Hashes in flash beat strings in PSRAM basically everywhere; the C3 just
makes it undeniable.

## Hardware

- Any **ESP32-C3** board (tested on a C3 SuperMini), 4 MB flash, **no PSRAM needed**
- Power it from a **stable USB source** (a phone charger or your router's USB port).
  Cheap/loose USB-C→A adapters can brown out the radio during WiFi transmit.
- A **USB-A → USB-C dongle** lets it plug straight into the spare USB port on the
  back of most routers — no power supply, no extra box.

### Enclosure

A printable case for the C3 SuperMini: [`hardware/esp32-c3-supermini-enclosure.stl`](hardware/esp32-c3-supermini-enclosure.stl)

Printing notes:
- No supports needed; 0.2 mm layers, ~15% infill is plenty.
- **Keep the antenna end clear.** The C3's PCB antenna is the zig-zag trace on the
  short edge opposite the USB-C port — don't bury it in solid plastic or put metal
  near it, or your RSSI will suffer.
- Leave the vents open: the board idles around 45–55 °C.

## Build & flash (PlatformIO)

One USB flash to get going — after that, **firmware and blocklist both update over WiFi** (see below).

```bash
# 1. set your WiFi creds (secrets.h is gitignored, so they stay local)
cp src/secrets.example.h src/secrets.h
#    then edit src/secrets.h -> WIFI_SSID / WIFI_PASS

# 2. build the blocklist hash table (default = StevenBlack base + Hagezi Light,
#    ~140k domains, WhatsApp/social safe)
python3 tools/build_blocklist.py data/blocklist.bin

# 3. flash firmware + the blocklist filesystem (the one and only USB flash)
pio run -t upload
pio run -t uploadfs

# 4. watch it boot, note the IP / open the dashboard
pio device monitor          # -> http://c3adblock.local
```

## Over-the-air updates (no more USB)

The dashboard at **http://c3adblock.local** does it all:

- **Blocklist** — drop a freshly built `blocklist.bin` into *Blocklist → Upload*, or set a
  URL under *Remote auto-update* and the device pulls a prebuilt `blocklist.bin`
  on a schedule (e.g. a GitHub release asset — update it once, every device fetches it).
- **Firmware** — upload `.pio/build/c3/firmware.bin` under *Firmware → OTA update*; the
  device verifies it and reboots into the new image. Or push over WiFi from the CLI:
  ```bash
  pio run -t upload --upload-port c3adblock.local --upload-protocol espota
  ```

**4 MB flash tradeoff:** firmware OTA needs *two* app slots, which leaves ~1.3 MB for the
blocklist (**~250k domains max**). The aggressive 537k "ultimate" list only fits the
single-app partition table (no firmware OTA). Pick your tradeoff in `partitions.csv`.

## Use it

Point a device's DNS at the C3's IP, or add it as a **secondary resolver** behind
your main DNS. Test:

```bash
dig @<c3-ip> doubleclick.net   # -> 0.0.0.0  (blocked)
dig @<c3-ip> github.com        # -> real IP  (forwarded)
```

## Gotchas (learned the hard way)

- **ModemManager** (default on Fedora/Ubuntu) grabs `/dev/ttyACM0` and toggles
  DTR/RTS, which **resets the C3** and blocks serial. Fix:
  ```bash
  sudo systemctl stop ModemManager
  echo 'ATTRS{idVendor}=="303a", ENV{ID_MM_DEVICE_IGNORE}="1"' | sudo tee /etc/udev/rules.d/99-esp-no-modemmanager.rules
  sudo udevadm control --reload-rules && sudo udevadm trigger
  ```
- The C3's USB-Serial-JTAG console can swallow early boot output until the host
  connects (`while(!Serial)` helps).
- DNS clients add an **EDNS OPT** record; a blocked reply must contain only the
  question + answer (ANCOUNT=1, NSCOUNT=ARCOUNT=0) or it's malformed.

## Done / how it could grow

- ✅ Web dashboard — per-client block/allow counts, ban a client, add custom domains
- ✅ mDNS (`c3adblock.local`) for discovery
- ✅ OTA — firmware + blocklist update over WiFi, plus scheduled remote blocklist pulls
- ✅ Fast pre-filter in RAM — 4096-entry first-level index + direct-mapped cache
  (replaces ~18 per-step flash reads with ~1 bucket read per suffix)
- ⬜ Bloom filter in RAM as an even tighter pre-filter (skip flash for the ~99% of misses)
- ⬜ Act as the DHCP server (hand itself out as DNS) for true plug-and-play
